Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I wanted to gain a better knowledge of how these algorithms work, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. 


Meet the Algorithms
This application supports the following algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm: the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

A* : arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

On top of the pathfinding algorithms listed above, I implemented a Recursive Backtracking Maze Generation algorithm.
